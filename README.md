# Rescue_Pets

A full-stack Android application designed to simplify the rescue of stray and injured animals. Users can easily report rescue cases by uploading images, location, and descriptions. Registered volunteers and admins can log in to view real-time reports and coordinate rescue efforts efficiently. The backend (currently under development) is built with Node.js and MongoDB, supporting image uploads, secure authentication, and role-based access. The frontend is being built using native Android for smooth user experience and responsiveness.
