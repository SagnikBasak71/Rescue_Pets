# Rescue_Pets


Rescue_Pets is a full-stack Android app that helps report and manage the rescue of stray and injured animals. Users can upload images, add location and descriptions, while volunteers and admins can view and act on reports. The backend is built with Node.js and MongoDB, using JWT for secure login and role-based access. The Android frontend is developed in Java with XML layouts, and APIs are integrated using Volley. Most of the backend is complete, and the frontend is almost done.
